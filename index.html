        <!-- HTML/CSS Resume
        
        Create a basic resume in HTML/CSS. Inline, style tag or external .css file for styles, anything is a go for now. Go as elaborate as you want with the content, HTML and CSS. If you find a use for JavaScript, feel free to integrate it as well.
        
        Make sure to attach a Git repository to your project right away, regularly commit your code and push it to GitHub. A live URL through GitHub pages is ideal for sharing your resume with the class next Tuesday.
